Functionality
Sensor Integration
Our system collects real-time data from DHT11, Soil Moisture, Water Level, and Rain sensors to provide comprehensive insights into environmental conditions.

Automatic Irrigation
Based on sensor data analysis, our system autonomously controls the water pump to maintain optimal soil moisture levels, ensuring your plants receive just the right amount of water they need.

Step Motor Control
With the help of a Step Motor, our system precisely adjusts irrigation positions, allowing for targeted watering and efficient water distribution.

Remote Control
Integrating seamlessly with the Blynk app, our system enables remote monitoring and control of irrigation settings from anywhere, providing you with ultimate convenience and flexibility.

Local Control
For manual intervention and fine-tuning, our system offers intuitive buttons for local control, allowing you to adjust parameters and irrigation schedules as per your requirements.

Data Display
Keep track of environmental conditions and irrigation status in real-time with our LCD display, providing you with actionable insights for better decision-making and garden management.
