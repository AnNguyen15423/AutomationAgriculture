Overview:
This project aims to develop an Automatic Irrigation System using various sensors including DHT11 for temperature and humidity, Soil Moisture sensor, Water Level sensor, and Rain sensor. The system utilizes a Step Motor to reach set positions and controls a water pump to maintain optimal soil moisture levels. Additionally, it offers remote control via the Blynk app and local control through buttons with data displayed on an LCD screen.

Components:
-DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor.
-Soil Moisture Sensor.
-Water Level Sensor.
-Rain Sensor.
-Step Motor.
-Water Pump.
-ESP32 microcontroller.
-LCD Display.
-Buttons for local control.
-Blynk app for remote control.

Functionality:
Sensor Integration: The system collects data from DHT11, Soil Moisture, Water Level, and Rain sensors to monitor environmental conditions.
Automatic Irrigation: Based on sensor data, the system automatically controls the water pump to adjust soil moisture levels.
Step Motor Control: Utilizes a Step Motor to reach predefined positions for irrigation.
Remote Control: Integrates with the Blynk app to allow remote monitoring and control of the irrigation system.
Local Control: Provides buttons for manual control and adjustment of system parameters.
Data Display: Real-time sensor data is displayed on an LCD screen for local monitoring.

Setup:
-Connect sensors (DHT11, Soil Moisture, Water Level, Rain) and actuators (Step Motor, Water Pump) to the Arduino or compatible microcontroller.
-Install the Blynk app on your smartphone and set up the interface to control the irrigation system remotely.
-Upload the ESP32 code provided in this repository to the microcontroller.
-Configure the Arduino code to ensure proper pin mappings and sensor calibration.
-Power on the system and monitor sensor data through the LCD display or the Blynk app.
-Use local buttons or the Blynk app to control the irrigation system as needed.
